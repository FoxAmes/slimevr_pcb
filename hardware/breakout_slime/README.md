# Breakout SlimeVR
This PCB design is intended as the easiest DIY SlimeVR pcb. It is a simple two
layer PCB, and should make assembling SlimeVR significantly easier than using a
protoboard.

**NOTE: This board is not yet finished, and has not been tested.** You may use it as
a reference or starting point, but please don't expect it to work yet ;)
